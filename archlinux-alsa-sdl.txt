archlinux alsa / sdl

In KDE multimedia settings I'm using phonon-gstreamer and I have also tried changing to phono-vlc. Sound in the application 'Clementine' doesn't work either. Sound is working fine for KDE desktop effects, amarok, juk, and dragonplayer, and Flash.

Using smplayer audio options I have set to alsa, and have tried all the alsa 0.1 etc options -- none work. I have also tried mplayer -vo alsa

mplayer ran from shell:

[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:1293:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open '/dev/snd/pcmC1D0p' failed (-2): No such file or directory
[AO_ALSA] Playback open error: No such file or directory
[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:1293:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open '/dev/snd/pcmC1D0p' failed (-2): No such file or directory

Could this issue be because for alsa I have  set my default sound card in user space (because I have USB mic)?

    ~/.asoundrc:

    # Setting default device
    pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
    device 0
    }
    ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
    device 0
    }
    # Enable mixing
    pcm.dsp {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "dmix"
    }
